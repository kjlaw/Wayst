##Wayst

#Inspiration
Popular methods of navigation assistance for bicyclists involves either using headphones or a monitor/display to determine directions. This inspired a desire to create a safer method. This was our primary motivation to develop Wayst. Our secondary motivation was driven by the need to improve the quality of life for the visually impaired.

#What it does
A headless and soundless piece of wearable technology that enables the user to safely travel and explore new areas using haptic feedback. It also detects nearby objects (within 1 meter) and informs the user.
